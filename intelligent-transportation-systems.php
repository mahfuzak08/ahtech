						<h3>Traffic Management Systems</h3>
						<p class="text-justify">The Siemens Traffic Sitraffic Concert traffic center is the solution of choice for strategic coordination of traffic control and traffic information systems. As Sitraffic Concert consists of smoothly integratable modules, you are free to choose only those modules that you need for your traffic management tasks. We have commissioned three major traffic management centers in (ADTMC, Yas Island and Al Reem Island) Abu Dhabi till date.</p>

						<h3>Tunnel Management Systems</h3>
						<p class="text-justify">The tunnel management system is responsible for ensuring the remote control and monitoring of relevant data points across the electromechanical systems. Using the information being constantly supplied, the tunnel management system prepares a graphic system overview which indicates the statuses of the various electromechanical systems alongside additional information. We have commissioned two major tunnel management systems (Ras Al Akhdar Tunnel and Yas Tunnel) in Abu Dhabi.</p>

						<h3>SCOOT Adaptive Traffic Control System</h3>
						<p class="text-justify">As the volume of traffic using the roadways continues to grow at a greater rate than the capacity of the road network, the effect of traffic congestion is an ever-increasing problem around the world. Siemens UTC (SCOOT) has proven itself in over 100 towns and cities across the globe as effective in reducing congestion and maximising the efficiency of the road network. UTC-UX is the latest release of the Yunex Traffic UTC software and builds on over 30 years of domain knowledge and experience gained from over 100 deployments worldwide to bring a brand-new user experience to the market. Our team of traffic engineering experts have implemented SCOOT at more than 250 intersections in Abu Dhabi covering six different regions. </p>
