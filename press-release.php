                        	<li>Powered by the latest Siemens technology, the system enables real-time monitoring and rapid data-driven decision-making</li>
                        	<li>Project delivers more than AED 10 million in annual savings and advances treatment capacity by approximately 20%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Abu Dhabi, 10 December 2024:</strong> TAQA Water Solutions, a leader in sustainable water solutions, today awarded an AED 95 million project to develop a comprehensive Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system across its treatment infrastructure, anchored by a new, centralised control facility. Announced during the IDRA World Congress 2024, this transformative project will drive environmental sustainability to enhance operational efficiency, reduce the company’s carbon footprint, and improve wastewater treatment capacity by approximately 20%. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Awarded to Electro Mechanical Company LLC supported by consultants TVA Engineering, and using the latest Siemens technology, at the core of this project is a state-of-the-art SCADA system. The SCADA technology will enable integrated, real-time monitoring and control of TAQA Water Solutions’ extensive network using over 2,000 high-performance sensors, transmitters, and instruments. The project will link all plants in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, with 91% of TAQA Water Solutions' wastewater collection and treatment assets benefiting from this integration. This ensures seamless, real-time oversight and efficient management across the entire infrastructure with a network that spans over 13,000 kilometres in length, 43 treatment plants, and 260 pumping stations.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">TAQA Water Solutions will leverage the new SCADA system to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability. By analysing and processing data gathered from across the Emirate, SCADA enables the company to identify trends, monitor remote sites, and receive real-time event notifications. This proactive approach allows for predictive maintenance and the anticipation and diagnosis of potential issues, optimising operational efficiency.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Furthermore, this data will help inform decisions about the company’s infrastructure and facilities, ensuring that new, upgraded, or existing infrastructure aligns with true operational needs, while adopting sustainable practices powered by the latest water technology. It will contribute to a cleaner, healthier environment for communities through early detection of breakdowns, wastewater overflows, and leaks.</p>
                        <h3>Key benefits of the centralised Siemens SCADA system upgrade include:</h3>
                        <ul>
                        	<li><strong>AI Smart monitoring for enhanced operational efficiency:</strong> Driving faster response times, reduced errors, and optimised performance, in addition to enabling data-driven decision-making on future infrastructure.</li>
                        	<li><strong>Sustainability gains:</strong> Once the system is fully implemented, our operations will reduce its carbon emissions of the treatment plants by up to 13%, equivalent to almost 6,500 metric tonnes annually.</li>
                        	<li><strong>Significant cost reduction:</strong> By implementing predictive maintenance, the project is expected to deliver a 12% reduction in maintenance costs and lower energy consumption, with total annual savings of over AED 10 million.</li>
                        	<li><strong>Strengthened security:</strong> Latest cybersecurity measures and physical security enhancements will bolster the safeguarding of critical infrastructure, reducing risk and increasing resilience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Eng. Ahmed Al Shamsi, CEO of TAQA Water Solutions, said:</strong> “This landmark AI-driven, large-scale automation project will significantly enhance TAQA Water Solutions’ operational excellence and environmental sustainability across our water treatment facilities. This strategic project will boost energy efficiency and expand treatment capacity, while reinforcing our commitment to public health and responsible resource management. By embracing the latest innovation, we are securing a sustainable, water-secure future for generations to come.”</p>
                        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Mr. Mohamed Abdul Aziz Rubayea Al Mehairi, Chairman of Electro Mechanical Company, Exclusive Agent for Siemens AG in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, said:</strong> “The new SCADA system will revolutionise TAQA Water Solutions' operations, enabling proactive wastewater management and optimised performance while boosting energy efficiency and ensuring full regulatory compliance. By implementing the latest technology, TAQA Water Solutions is setting a benchmark for the region."</p>
                        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Mohammed Khalifa, CEO Digital Industries for Siemens in the Middle East said:</strong> “Collaboration is essential for tackling today’s water challenges, and we are excited to work alongside TAQA Water Solutions and Electro Mechanical Co. on this project. By leveraging Siemens technology, the aim is to enhance system efficiency, improve water quality, and advance sustainability. Together, we are demonstrating how shared expertise can lead to impactful transformation in the water industry.”</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">This strategic project by TAQA Water Solutions underscores the company's commitment to leveraging technology for a more sustainable future, for the benefit of its communities and the environment.</p>
